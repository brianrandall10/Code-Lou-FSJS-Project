# FSJS-Project


This is the repo for my project for Code Louisville Full Stack Javascript.


It is a child check in system for a child care facility.
A basic page will be to simply enter a childs name and assign a pin number. It will be only available to staff and will be saved in a database using Mongodb.
It will have a simple site to check children in and out providing time stamp logs.

The logs can be saved and used for reporting purposes.

The main html files are located in the public\javascripts folder.
